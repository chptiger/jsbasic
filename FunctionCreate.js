 * 
 * function declaration vs function operator 
 *	Functions made with a function declaration are moved to the top of the code and created before the rest of the function is run.
 *  Functions made with the function operator are created at runtime where they are in the javascript code.
 * 
 * Conclusion:
 * 	functions made with the function operator is better, because it's only created where the code need it.
